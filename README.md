## Basic Overview - 

Many Farmers struggle for their goods to be sold in the market at a price that is
beneficial to them. Most of the time a third person is involved between the consumers and the farmers and they end up buying the product for a very low price and selling it at a very high amount to the consumers​. our ​aim to bridge this gap and have worked on a product that will aid not only the farmers but also the consumers buy boost the profits of the farmers and at the same time reducing the expenditure of a consumer.
